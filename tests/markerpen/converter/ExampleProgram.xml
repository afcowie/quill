This is a simple java-gnome program. As you
will see, there's really nothing to it that
you need to be worried about:

<programlisting xml:space="preserve">
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Gtk.init(args);
        Gtk.main();
    }
}
</programlisting>

This program has the drawback of not doing
very much and even worse, not telling you
that that's not what it's doing.
</para>
<para>
The way you fix that is by not making the
call to <function>Gtk.main()</function> and
instead just letting the program exit.
