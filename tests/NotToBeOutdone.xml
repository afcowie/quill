Coming back for seconds
</chapter>
<text>
While the editor you see is only presenting the series of blocks
making up one chapter, a book is many such chapters, and this
is what <project>Quill</project> supports. This is the second
chapter in the example document, where various other things that
need to be exercised were dumped.

Business this week
</heading>
<text>
The American space agency, <acronym>NASA</acronym>, reports that
they have run out of paperclips.

<text>
The <acronym>G20</acronym> has a legitimacy lacking in other
economic clubs, such as the rich country only <acronym>G7</acronym>
... Unfortunately history suggests that big-picture debates on
the future of the international monetary system rarely yield
results. France should take note. The <acronym>G20</acronym>
will remain worth having only if it sticks to the art of the
possible.<note ref="1"/>

The virtues of Incompleteness

There are several things to take aboard reading this chapter.
</text>
<list label="•">
The user interface is far from complete; terribly sorry about
that, but the we've been working on other areas of the project,
and so now what the underlying file format supports has far outstripped
the capabilities of the <project>Quill</project> editor.
</list>
<list label="•">
The Parchment File Format is, or should be, stable now, and
<project>Parchment</project> <bold>will</bold> properly render
everything in it. So now we have a clear goal to work toward,
and we will be building better editor support in the coming months.
</list>
<text>
And that's it. No more list for you.

To Be Continued

<text>
This section's label is wider than the default allowance, so
the heading body text should be pushed to the right accordingly.
