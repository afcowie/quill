  Given how long FontDescription strings are, these knobs are given one per
  element, so that each one will fit on a single 78 character wide line.
  This isn't perfect from a validation perspective (the reality is that four
  font elements need to be declared, one per), but it is the best we can do
  given the aesthetic we're trying for.
