HACKING

To work on Quill, import this source tree as an Eclipse project called
"quill". Follow the same pattern for setting up `~/workspace/quill` being a
checkout of `~/src/quill/mainline` as you have done following java-gnome's
`HACKING` instructions.

The TODO and BUGS files are actually maintained as chapters in a .parchment
manuscript which you can render with Parchment and edit with Quill. Run:

    $ ./quill doc/about/HackingOnQuill.parchment

to see these files as chapters. It's a good example document.
