=====

Make does too much
------------------

For some reason `make test` is actually rebuilding everything.

========

Need an offset cache
--------------------

The data structure used to back a TextChain is a mutable linked list; that's
fine for arbitrary insertions, but our real need is to find Spans at given
offsets and to break Spans (creating boundaries) at given offsets.

This was fine for preliminary implementation, but with the addition of spell
checking we have probably hit O(nÂ²) or worse when it comes to driving down
splices as we iterate create Span boundaries at word beginnings and endings.
