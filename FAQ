Frequently Asked Questions

> What is Quill written in?

What do you care?

> No, seriously.

Ok, since you ask, it's a GNOME program written with the GTK user interface
toolkit.

> Really? But I heard it's in Java.

Yes it is. So?

> But Java is horrible and huge.

The Java Virtual Machine is a remarkable piece of technology. It efficiently
uses memory and CPU given to it. And meanwhile, were you short of RAM on your
desktop or something?

> And Java programs look ugly.

Oh! You mean programs written in Swing. You're right — Sun's UI toolkit is
hideous to develop with and even worse for the people using it. And it looks
like shit on screen. But that's ok. We don't use Swing.

Quill's user interface is in GTK and written using the excellent
[java-gnome][] UI library.

> I thought Quill was written with Qt since it begins with a 'Q'

Get over it.

> Does Quill run on Windows?

Sure. Any version of X Windows newer than 7.3 should be fine. We run X.org's
xorg-server, of course. We do use a lot of recent features from Cairo and
Pango, so you'll need to use the latest releases there.

> Uh, I meant Microsoft Vista and stuff...

Oh. Really? Why would anyone use that? It's proprietary software.
