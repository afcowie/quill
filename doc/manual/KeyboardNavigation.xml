Keyboard shortcuts

Actually, they're not really shortcuts. They're the way you use
Quill!

Formatting
</heading>
<text>
Different semantic markup can be applied. The various formats
can be applied by typing <keyboard>Ctrl+Shift+&lt;Key&gt;</keyboard>.
</text>
<text>
You can never get away from legacy, so bold and italics are
<keyboard>Ctrl+B</keyboard> and <keyboard>Ctrl+I</keyboard> respectively.
It's not like we were going to use those combinations for something
else, and as much as consistency is important, we're not trying
to make people's lives difficult.

<text>
Ultimately the point is to ensure consistent display of the resultant
markup. You don't need an <type>Inline</type> for bloody every
last thing under the sun. People will doubtless rant on about
how they're favourite thing isn't available. [Last week it was
someone complaining that there wasn't a strong semantic for ship
names, and that as a result she couldn't say "USS
<italics>Enterprise</italics>" consistently. Yeah. Sorry about
that. Really] But you have a fair range to choose from and if
you are desperate you can always hack your <type>RenderEngine</type>
to do something different. Remember that the point is to ensure
consistent display of different classes of text; the person who
wanted ship names in italics can just use
<literal>&lt;publication&gt;</literal> to get herself italics.
