<heading>
File format
</heading>
<text>
The on-disk format needs to be completed, and finalized as
<literal>1.0</literal>.
</text>
<text>
<bold>Launching documents from Nautilus</bold>
</text>
<text>
Once the format is finalized, we need to register a MIME type with
GNOME via a <literal>.desktop</literal> file so that documents are
launched when opened by the <project>Nautilus</project> file browser
or with <command>gnome-open</command> from the command line.
</text>
<text>
This will probably also require single instance code via
[org.gnome.notify] <type>Notify</type>. We'll need to have a mechanism
to differentiate between development and normal use (start new
instance &amp; terminate existing vs just load into existing
instance?).
</text>
<text>
Should individual chapters be launchable, or just the document?
</text>
<heading>
User interface
</heading>
<text>
<bold>Editor for notes and references</bold>
</text>
<text>
While loading, display, rendering, and saving of documents with
<literal>&lt;note&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;cite&gt;</literal>
tags is implemented, there's no user interface for adding or creating
these markers yet, nor editing the reference bodies.
</text>
<text>
<bold>Document word lists</bold>
</text>
<text>
While we have enabled adding words to the user's custom dictionary via
"Add" in the suggestions menu, it may make sense to add words to the
document. Perhaps this is just "Ignore"?
</text>
<text>
This will likely make more sense when we have a proper notion of
document and can store a word list there.
