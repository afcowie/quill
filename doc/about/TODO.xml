File handling

<text>
<bold>Launching documents from Nautilus</bold>
</text>
<text>
Once the format is finalized, we need to register a MIME type with
GNOME via a <literal>.desktop</literal> file so that documents are
launched when opened by the <project>Nautilus</project> file browser
or with <command>gnome-open</command> from the command line.
</text>
<text>
This will probably also require single instance code via
[org.gnome.notify] <type>Notify</type>. We'll need to have a mechanism
to differentiate between development and normal use (start new
instance &amp; terminate existing vs just load into existing
instance?).

User interface
</heading>
<text>
<bold>Editor for notes and references</bold>
</text>
<text>
While loading, display, rendering, and saving of documents with
<literal>&lt;note&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;cite&gt;</literal>
tags is implemented, there's no user interface for adding or creating
these markers yet, nor editing the reference bodies.
</text>
<text>
<bold>Inserting chapters</bold>
</text>
<text>
There's not yet any <acronym>UI</acronym> for actually inserting a new
chapter (be it a <literal>&lt;chapter&gt;</literal> or
<literal>&lt;part&gt;</literal>).
</text>
<text>
<bold>Search</bold>
</text>
<text>
Need search in text hooked up to <keyboard>Ctrl+F</keyboard>. Should
it be in a horizontal bar like <project>Epiphany</project> and
<project>Devhelp</project> or should it be a popup dialog like
<project>GEdit</project> and <project>Eclipse</project>?
