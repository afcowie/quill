<type>StructuralChange</type><bold> at first
character misplaces new Segment</bold>
</text>
<text>
For some reason, if you're at offset
<literal>0</literal> of a
<type>NormalEditorTextView</type> and you
<bold>Ins</bold> you end up with a new Segment
not prepended in front of that Segment, but
appended after the Segment.
</text>
<text>
<bold>Scrolling on new </bold><type>Segment</type>
<bold> insert</bold>
</text>
<text>
Inserting a Section heading from last line
of last <type>NormalEditorTextView</type>,
then cursor <bold>Down</bold> doesn't cause
the new line to be scrolled into visible
area of <type>ComponentEditorWidget</type>.
</text>
<text>
<type>Segment</type><bold> text needs escaping
before passing to GTK </bold><type>Label</type>
<bold>?</bold>
</text>
<text>
If you put the text <literal>&lt;!--</literal>
into a section heading, then <bold>F3</bold>
Outline, the application crashes with an
error from <type>Label</type>'s
<literal>setUseMarkup()</literal>.
</text>
<text>
<bold>Selection should be cleared when leaving
</bold><type>EditorTextView</type>
</text>
<text>
If you select text in one editor, then you
click in another, moving the focus, the TextView
which looses focus sets the selected region
the semi-tone "I'm inactive but still have
a selection" colour.
</text>
<text>
It should probably be cleared so the behaviour
is consistent with there only being one
<type>TextView</type>.
</text>

<text>
<bold>Undo stack is unbounded</bold>
</text>
<text>
The undo stack is a <type>LinkedList</type>
right now; nothing is acting to constrain
its size or clean off older entries. Unlimited
undo steps is cool; unconstrained memory
consumption until exhaustion is not.
</text>
<text>
Making it <type>WeakReference</type> doesn't
quite seem sufficient; we can't have items
arbitrarily disappearing. Perhaps an
<type>ArrayDequeue</type>?
</text>
<text>
<bold>Caching result of render</bold>
</text>
<text>
Right now the <type>PreviewWidget</type>'s
<literal>ExposeEvent</literal> runs the entire
<type>RenderEngine</type>; we need to cache
the result and only update the result of
processing Segments into <type>Area</type>s
and <type>Page</type>s if the current
<type>Change</type> object is no longer the
same as that when the render happened.

Render Engine

<text>
<bold>Markup in headings is not scaled properly</bold>
</text>
<text>
The current method of making the heading
larger applies only on the actual
<literal>headingFont</literal>. If you put
markup (Type, for example) into a
<type>HeadingSegment</type> then when it
renders it will use <literal>sansFont</literal>
at whatever that font is sized at, not at
the larger size of the heading.

Copyright
</heading>
<text>
<bold>Need strong copyright handling</bold>
</text>
<text>
The mere presence of this section as text
in a <type>QuoteSegment</type>, and not metadata
or otherwise with a purpose built UI, is
a bug. <literal>:)</literal>
