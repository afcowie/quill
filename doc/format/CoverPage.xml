rendering engine is a little unconventional: it's text based, so you
can use version control. The schema is extraordinarily simplistic,
meaning that it can be worked with programmatically. More importantly,
it can be fixed by humans when it breaks. And finally, the format is
actually designed to support technical writing and technical
writers.</italics>

<italics>But if you're interested in the design decisions that led to
the Parchment File Format being what it is, then you will find here
some background along with our documentation of the "Manuscript
Schema" (found in the </italics>
<literal>.parchment</literal><italics> files), and the "Quack Schema"
(the chapters in </italics><literal>.xml</literal><italics> files that
make up those manuscripts).</italics>
