Document word lists
</heading>
<text>
When writing, especially when writing technical documentation, we
frequently use words and terms that are unknown to the dictionary of
our chosen language. We can "Add" such words so that they are ignored
by the spell checker, but adding them to the user's personal
dictionary on the local system is pointless: as soon as they share the
document with anyone else, the words will be marked misspelled again.

<text>
Thus when marking a word as not a mistake, we add that word to a
document word list. The format is one word per line, as follows:
</text>
<code xml:space="preserve">
# Document word list
blockquote
endnote
inlines
NormalSegment
stylesheet
</code>
<text>
and so on. The file is optional, but if it has been created it is
sorted alphabetically, and placed in a file with the same basename as
the manuscript and with a <literal>.dic</literal> extension; again in
the example of this document, the word list is
<filename>ParchmentFileFormat.dic</filename> and should be added to
version control.
