Background

<text>
Writing is already hard enough. It's really not to be borne that
the tools we have to write with make it harder.

Criteria

Thus we have the following criteria:

<text>
you can fix the quack on disk if Quill breaks, but if you break
the file on disk you'll break Quill.

you can't expect Quill to figure it out

<bold>Why did you create your own XML schema?</bold>
</text>
<text>
You use a commonly available format if you wish to interoperate.
But (at least at present) we're not worried about that; Quack
format documents are for consumption by <project>Quill</project>
and rendering by <project>Parchment</project>.
</text>
<text>
Quack is not intended to be human <italics>writable</italics>.
And it's not particularly meant for reading by other programs.
But it is human <italics>mergeable</italics>.

As mentioned, the driving imperative for Quack documents is that
they be manageable with the collaboration tools we use to write
open source software - specifically the modern 3rd generation
distributed version control systems (<acronym>DVCS</acronym>)
such as <project>Bazaar</project> (<command>bzr</command>),
<project>Git</project> (<command>git</command>), or
<project>Mercurial</project> (<command>hg</command>).
