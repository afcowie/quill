INSTALL

This project is still in the inception phases, so at the moment there is no
build infrastructure.

You will need the following prerequisites:

 - java-gnome	>= 4.0.10 (and, probably, 'mainline')
 - xom		>= 1.2.1

To build Quill, import this source tree as an Eclipse project called "quill".
Follow the same pattern for setting up `~/workspace/quill` being a checkout of
`~/src/quill/mainline` as you have done following java-gnome's `HACKING`
instructions.
