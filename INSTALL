INSTALL

This project is still in the inception phases, so at the moment there is not
really a proper build infrastructure. There is a minimal configure script and
Makefile; [temporarily] edit .config that configure produces for your local
environment.

Dependencies
------------

You will need the following prerequisites:

 - java-gnome	>= 4.0.17-rc2 ('mainline' from bzr is always best)
 - xom		>= 1.2.1  (note Ubuntu and Gentoo 1.1 packages not sufficent)

Build
-----

To build Quill, run:

	./configure
	make
	make test

Then, to use it,

	./quill

or

	./quill DocumentFileName.parchment


Install
-------

TODO.
