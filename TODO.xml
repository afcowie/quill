<bold>Line wrapping of XML output</bold>
</text>
<text>
The line-breaking algorithm in
<application>Xom</application> is rather
poor: it takes the maximum line length specified,
subtracts 10, and then looks for a possible
line break after that point. This makes for
erratic justification, trailing space characters,
and other artifacts. This is due to
<application>Xom</application>'s
<type>Serializer</type> handles its output
one character at a time and has no look ahead
/ read back capability.
</text>
<text>
It may be better for us to write the output
file to a <type>StringWriter</type> or
<type>ByteArrayOutputStream</type> and then
do the breaks manually by doing <literal>'
'</literal> to <literal>'\n' </literal>replacements.
</text>
<text>
For what it's worth, though, it's getting
closer to the point where <italics>not</italics>
using <application>Xom</application> and
just doing the really minimal XML work ourselves
would be feasible. Not really that interested
going down the not-invented-here road, but...

User interface

<text>
<bold>Editor for notes and references</bold>
</text>
<text>
While loading, display, rendering, and saving
of documents with <literal>&lt;note&gt;</literal>
and <literal>&lt;cite&gt;</literal> tags
is implemented, there's no user interface
for adding or creating these markers yet,
nor editing the reference bodies.

<text>
<bold>Word count</bold>
</text>
<text>
Needs a feature where we can do a word count
for the {chapter, essay, document}. Question:
how to treat program code?

Build
</heading>
<text>
<bold>Needs a proper build system</bold>
</text>
<text>
Top level configure is just a quick hack;
probably need to copy in equivalence from
<application>java-gnome</application> or
<application>Slashtime</application>, though
this application is potentially an opportunity
to try something new.
