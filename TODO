Line wrapping of XML output
---------------------------

The linebreaking algorithm in XOM is rather poor: it takes the max line length
specified, subtracts 10, and then looks for a possible line break after that
point, which makes for erratic justification, trailing space characters, and
other artifacts. This is because it handles its output one character at a time
and has no look ahead / read back capability.

It may be better for us to write the output file to a StringWriter or
ByteArrayOutputStream and then do the breaks manually by doing ' ' to '\n'
replacements.


User interface
==============

Cursor movement
---------------

We should refine the positioning algorithm. At present now you get drifted to
the left rather than it remembering where (column? x?) you were recently and
returning there when back on a longer line.

Editor for notes and references
-------------------------------

While loading, display, rendering, and saving of documents with <note> and
<cite> tags is implemented, there's no user interface for adding or creating
these markers yet, nor editing the reference bodies.


Build
=====

Needs a proper build system
---------------------------

Top level configure is just a quick hack; probably need to copy in equivalence
from java-gnome or Slashtime.
